Hierarchical clustering adopts either an agglomerative or divisive method to build a hierarchy of clusters. Regardless of which approach is adopted, both initially use a distance similarity measure to combine clusters or split clusters. The recursive process continues until there is only one cluster left or one cannot split more clusters. Eventually, one can use a dendrogram to represent the hierarchy of clusters. 

use hotel.csv file and

a) show how to cluster hotel location data with hierarchical clustering. That is  perform hierarchical clustering on hotel location data to identify whether the hotels are located in the same district. 


Also  cut the hierarchy of clusters into 3.

b) using k-means clsuter location data for 3 clusters

c) compare both clustering methods accuracy
