A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author, title, price , publisher and stock position.
- Whenever a customer wants book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not.
- If it in not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required.
- If the reqested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed; otherwise the message "Required copies not in stock" is displayed.
Design a system using a class called books with suitable member functions and Constructors. Allcate memory dynamically in  constructor to allocate memory space required.
